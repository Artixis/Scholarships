Web Scraping for NSW University Scholarships

The following git repo contains a task for Scholarships Operations Group in which we research the scholarships being offered at the following universities:
- UNSW - Half done, code can be found in Scholarship_Scrape.py - needs to be heavily modified but have a lot of code to work with now to fix issues. 
- USYD - The final boss 
- Charles Sturt - Done - needs cleaning
- University of Wollongong - **Done** - needs cleaning
- University of Newcaslte - **Done** on home computer
- Maquarie University - **Done**
- UTS - **Done**

The main goal is to collect information on their Equity, High Potential and Humanitarian Scholarships. For now, some have been done manually when convenient
while others have been automated using web scrapping.

### Updates

- Scholarships have been merged with the exception of USYD. Code needs to be written up for this university.
- Basic cleaning has been done on first merge, for Level, Duration, Type and Blanks.
- One of the Universities in the merged file is not complete (I think is UOW - light blue)
  - Find this and check against the main webpage if scholarships are missing.
